codeserver
----------

this repo is being used to store the docker-compose.yml which I personally used
on my development machine--- to run codeserver.

- make sure that the machine has docker installed
    - engine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
    - script;
        - `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh`
        - `sudo sh get-docker.sh`
- it should install docker-compose as docker's plugin
    - check by `docker compose version`
    - add `alias docker-compose='docker compose'` to your `.bashrc` files
